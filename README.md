## project

I am required to design Web Client will act as a GUI for the entire Car Hire Booking System. This GUI will allow a booking
to be Created, Read, Updated or Deleted.

Design a RESTful Web Service using JAX-RS/Jersey which will act as the gateway for all clients
which wish to use the Car Hire Booking System. Clients will be able to access CRUD functionality for
car hire bookings using the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.

The following diagram depicts the overall system architecture:
